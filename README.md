# Purpose

This library is intended to be used in build tools to take manual test cases written in the [Gherkin Syntax](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/)
And render them into the KiwiTCMS, handling cases, plans, component mapping, and attachments.

TODO:
- Better formatting
- Image handling
- Setting up Test Runs
- Rendering test case to something local, like CSV.
- Automated testing, current tests of the ant task assume you've got a throwaway Kiwi instance to use.

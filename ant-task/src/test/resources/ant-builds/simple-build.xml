<!--
This is the ANT build file for OpenDCS 6.7 RC02 and Later.
The intent is that this will eventually be replaced with a Maven pom.xml.
To get started run
ant test
This will verify that everything can compile and tests can run
NOTE at this time jdk8 must be used as there is still a dependency on tools.jar
